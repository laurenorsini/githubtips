Creating Your Online Repository

Now that you’re all set up, it’s time to create a place for your project to live. Both Git and GitHub refer to this as a repository or “repo” for short, a digital directory or storage space where you can access your project, its files, and all the versions of its files that Git saves. 

Go back to GitHub.com and click the tiny book icon next to your username. Or, go to https://github.com/new if all the icons look the same. Give your repository a short, memorable name. Go ahead and make it public just for kicks; why hide your attempt to learn GitHub? 

Don’t worry about clicking the check box next to “Initialize this repository with a README.” A Readme file is usually a text file that explains a bit about the project. But we can make our own Readme file locally for practice. 

Click the green “Create Repository” button and you’re set. You now have an online space for your project to live in.
